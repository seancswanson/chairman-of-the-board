### Versioning

> As of **December 9,2017** this game is in development whilst enrolled in General Assembly's WDI program.

> As of **December 10,2017** working on start splash screen and interactive elements including buttons, noise, and instructions. Added a place to keep track of scores. Declared majority of variables. Beginning of game logic.

> As of **December 11, 2017** working on restructuring jobPositions opbject for easier digging, using that information to populate game screen divs for interaction. Added basic menu navigation, instructions, initial start/load game functionality. Created functions attached to choices to return results and score modifiers... coming along!

> As of **December 12, 2017** working on setting up the logic to cumulatively keep track of scores, re worked how to show results of actions, how to move to the next scenario in that same job title. Pretty much just setting index variables that iterate++ to move the game along.

> As of **December 13, 2017** added buttons for whether the user would like to use confidence points or brownie points to get promoted to the next job title, had to clean up indentation and structure of jobPositions object... stuck in bracket hell for a while. Added new job levels ("Sales Manager, President of Sales"). Generalized and refactored my main game function to now be scalable if I want to add more levels and scenarios in the future.

> As of **December 14, 2017** added a game win condition, cleaned up code, added more job content. Drew a lot of inspiration from my father's game which featured quite a bit of tongue-in-cheek wit.

> As of **December 15, 2017** the game is COMPLETED! Wahoo! I split up the javaScript files for readability. Added more comments. Added a win message to congratulate the player! The game is live on seanthaswan.github.io/chairman-of-the-board

> As of **December 16, 2017** added a button click noise to break the utter silence. 

## If I had more time I would...

> Go back and shuffle the scenarios so they could be played in any order randomized on load.

> Insert 'wild card' events which don't involve choices but randomly come up and affect the score negativley or positively.
